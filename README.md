# Backgammon Reinforcement Learning Project
This project focuses on implementing AlphaZero algorithm for a stochastic environment and comparing results to the TD-gammon engine developed by Tesauro. 

## Project Outline

### 1. **Introduction**
    - This repository serves as an initial project layout for the backgammon engine. 
    - It should be noted that I need better optimization in order to get a reasonable number of position evalutated per second. 
    - For the above reason, I have decided to scrap the project.
